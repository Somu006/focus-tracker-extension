# focus-tracker-extension
FocusTracker is a minimalist Chrome extension that helps you track your focus state in real-time — whether you're in the zone or drifting away.  Whether you're studying, coding, or working, just click the extension icon to toggle your focus mode, or let the extension automatically switch you to “Out of Focus” when you go idle.
